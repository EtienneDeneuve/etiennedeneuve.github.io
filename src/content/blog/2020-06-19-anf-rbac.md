## Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files is a first party service in Azure to achieve more with storage.
ANF is an Enterprise grade storage in Azure, which can be used for heavy storage workload like SAP, AKS and VDI.

## Managing RBAC in ANF

At this time, there's no built-in roles in Azure AD for allow or deny part of Azure NetApp Files.

I created a Terraform template available in my GitHub [here](https://github.com/EtienneDeneuve/AzureNetappFiles/tree/master/custom_roles).

The following list of custom role is subject to evolve but here a quick list :

- Azure NetApp Files - Volumes Administrator
- Azure NetApp Files - Snapshot Administrator
- Azure NetApp Files - Backup Administrator
- Azure NetApp Files - Capacity Pool Administrator
- Azure NetApp Files - Replication Administrator
- Azure NetApp Files - Read Only
